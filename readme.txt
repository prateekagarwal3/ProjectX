(group1)Consonants Image Size : 75 X 75 (~average size of all the original images)
(group2)Vowels Image Size : 40 X 40 (~average size of all original images)

Next Step :- Generate pdf of characters.
Next Step :- Applying EM Alogrithm 
Next Step :- Correctly use PLSI and get set of strokes.

Prateek's codes are in 1.1 :)
Mango's codes are in 1.2 :P

1.0 contains codes which were implemented when PLSI was implemented by us for the first time :|
1.2 contains strokes after 100 iterations in folder "Stroke"
1.3 contains strokes after 40 iterations in folder "Stroke". The program ran on all samples of the first 30 characters(F004-F033)
1.4 contains the current implementation which seems right and few graphs.I ran it for F004 - F064 & Generated Strokes are in "Stroke Folder".

Project Report contains the pdf and latex files which were used to create the report.

Strokes and Plot contains strokes genrated on the 2517 data set with strokes as 10 for 40 iterations and plots of the same

Original Data Set contains the Data Set given to us by Sir. Please dont modify that directory .
